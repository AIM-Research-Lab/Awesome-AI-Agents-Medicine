# LLM-based Agents in Healthcare and Medicine: A Curated List

> **Abstract (from our survey):**  
> Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly migrating from text-only chatbots to **agentic systems** that plan, act, and collaborate within clinical workflows. This repository supplements our TPAMI survey on LLM-based medical agents, providing a living collection of research papers, implementations, and resources.  
> Each entry is annotated with **functional tags**, **tool-usage type**, and **autonomy level**, along with links to the **paper** and **code (if available)**.  
> We welcome community contributions through pull requests.
