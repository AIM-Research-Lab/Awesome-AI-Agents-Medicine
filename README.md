> **<p align="justify"> Abstract:** *Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly migrating from text-only chatbots to agentic systems that plan, act, and collaborate within clinical workflows. 
However, existing reviews have not fully addressed healthcare's demands for multimodal reasoning, transparency, and safety.  This survey systematically analyzes over 120 studies from 2018 to 2025 on LLM-based medical agents, offering three key contributions. First, we introduce a unified taxonomy spanning application domains, autonomy levels, and integration of tools and knowledge, effectively categorizing use cases across various biomedical areas. Second, we explore how state-of-the-art agents integrate biomedical expertise, couple LLM reasoning with external resources (e.g., clinical databases, electronic health records, APIs), and implement human-in-the-loop mechanisms to mitigate hallucinations and biases. Third, we synthesize cross-domain insights from fields such as education, robotics, and automated scientific discovery, highlighting transferable design principles for improved reliability and interpretability. Our analysis identifies persistent challenges—hallucinations, biases, data-privacy risks, and regulatory complexities—and surveys promising solutions. Finally, we propose open research directions toward creating trustworthy, regulation-compliant agents that augment rather than replace clinical expertise, providing researchers, practitioners, and policymakers a comprehensive roadmap for advancing agentic AI in healthcare. * </p>
